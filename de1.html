          <p><u>Project</u>: 2.1.5 AOI Circuit Design <br> <u>Course</u>: Honors Digital Electronics <br> <u>Duration</u>: Nov 7 - Nov 22 2022 <br> <u>Objective</u>: Create a purposeful control system which uses AOI Logic with 6 unique inputs and 3 unique outputs, all integrating to one output. <br> <u>Type of Project</u>: Group Project</p>
          <p> <b> - </b> </p>
          <p>Companies are taking drones into consideration as ways to drop deliveries to homes. However, drone training is dangerous. To practice flying drones, drone pilots need larger areas to model the real world. Since companies could be using drones to drop off deliveries, it is vital for their employees to understand how to control a drone. Training people to use drones is difficult; think about the costs of repairing broken drones due to obstacles, safety liabilities, and how large training zones would need to be to model a real-world delivery. These cost and safety issues are problems we aim to solve. <br>
            As per the project’s <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PbJQm46WgYk6Gy3zGOO5KffeDOvX2_5N/view?usp=share_link" target="_blank">rubric</a>, we needed to build a control system with AOI logic. The constraints are that the overall system must have at least 6 unique inputs and at least 3 unique outputs, and must integrate 3 individual outputs into 1 integrated output. To meet this, we took a unique spin on the project criteria, looking toward real-world problems for inspiration. Since the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PbJQm46WgYk6Gy3zGOO5KffeDOvX2_5N/view?usp=share_link" target="_blank">rubric</a> asked for three individual outputs to be integrated, I realized this could be connected to the 3 axes of aerodynamics. It was difficult at first to work on the specifics even at the individual board scale, as we did not know that much about aerodynamics. However, controlling a drone from the three axes was simpler than a plane, which is how we overcame part of the challenge. From there, as a partner looked through drone forums to find how the motors change drone orientation, we could see the project coming together. From there, we had to work as a team to figure out how to integrate those three axes. This created complexity since we could only work with a purpose that we would be able to physically create. Brainstorming as a team, we came up with a few ideas. I brought up how we could create a target system, and then as a team, we built upon the idea. We drew out the specifics for how it would work, from the motor configurations to comparing the “target system” to a passcode. Since I was good at understanding challenges by drawing them out, I worked to collect inputs and ideas from our team and create a picture. After consulting with each other and our teacher, we understood that there were two possibilities for our integrated output. We could either use a set of flip flops to hold the bit and output three “directions” of the drone, by changing the inputs 3 times. Then, from these nine flip-flops, we could create an array of LEDs for output. If we were unable to implement this solution, we understood that we could also fall back to taking each individual output and routing it to a row of 3 LEDs. The LEDs could represent which current direction or orientation was changing on the drone. My role was to create the array of LEDs which would take its input from the flip flops, as well as try to build the flip flops myself. However, since I was also in charge of the documentation, I knew that I could not take care of so many tasks. Therefore, my teammate tried building the flip-flops, while I focused on the documentation and the LED array. However, while trying to connect the flip flops and LED array to the main boards (I had breadboarded the yaw, while my teammates did the other two), we noticed that the flip flops would only work sometimes. We were not sure why we were encountering this obstacle and tried to use a multimeter to figure it out. Each of us had verified that the flip flops were breadboarded correctly, and the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BVroLiZFafzyynjywU89E4gkl8GbaUgT/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Multisim</a> was working with this setup. Thanks to the multimeter, we realized that there was a loss of power within the flip-flop circuit. This meant that the flip-flops were not working reliably and that we could not use them. With the time constraint, we moved to our backup plan. I set up the 3 LEDs and integrated the outputs. While integrating, I also made sure that the individual boards stayed organized while bringing all the inputs to one board. By labeling the wires and the breadboard, I steered clear of any errors. I had learned my lesson while breadboarding my one aerodynamic direction, yaw, thanks to the number of gates and wires. Thus, with that lesson in mind, integrating the boards was far simpler with the labels. While my team worked on the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BVroLiZFafzyynjywU89E4gkl8GbaUgT/view?usp=sharing">Multisim</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H0ylmSTSfVE-mxpFU8EBQwz3oy-psxqDcVFSvQwdYfo/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank">truth tables</a>, I focused on finishing the design brief and finalizing the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QlQtiZiezrRvdUWxbmTOtrPWsRysPrRO/view?usp=sharing" target="blank">documentation</a>. The completed project can be seen in the pictures below.
