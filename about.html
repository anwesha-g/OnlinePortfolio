                  <h3>Hello, I'm Anwesha.</h3>
                  <p>I love the idea of taking risks. From finding something new to creating something from scratch. I feel like I’ve always been curious. It started by trying out hydraulics, where I had built a pair of bird wings out of paint stirrers. From there, I kept innovating and reaching out to every opportunity I could grasp. I found myself learning how to build a drone in my garage, staring at the guts of motherboards. The risk, the confusion, and the satisfaction that came with figuring things out and climbing over obstacles brought me back time and time again. No matter how much I thought I hated staring at the same pieces of code or circuitry, I realized that I enjoyed the game. As long as there was some logic to what was occurring, some version of science (like biology or physics) involved, I would never get bored. I remember watching Star Wars with my dad for the first time, and him telling me that the Falcon was a real ship. The dream's crushed now but I think sometimes I look back and enjoy the fantasy of it all. I want to be the R2D2 to my own Millenium Falcon. I completed a research study, completed being a very loose term since I believe I will be revisiting the topic again to go deeper. The science fair project brought me some exposure to the field of sustainable energy through biochemical engineering and computer science. I hope to major in the cross sections of Biophysics or Biology applied to Computer Science. No matter what discipline I choose, I would focus on a research-oriented program. I enjoy the curiosity and the ambition research allows me to have. To do so, I hope to graduate from Dublin High with an Engineering certificate and deep-dive into Biology or Physics. I would like to conduct research alongside a professor on these subjects at some point to help the world in any way I can. <br> </br>
                  I remember breaking down my science fair project, and the realization that I would need to be able to showcase a project within a month like a jolt into reality. My mind kept running back to how all the other competitors over Zoom seemed to have it all figured out, with mentors guiding them. My confidence was shattered, and without a mentor guiding me, I felt like a fish on land. Some part of me wanted to give up, and just pretend that I never signed up for this, but it didn’t sit right with me to leave something midway. I reminded myself how disappointed I would be if I let go of this project. Curiosity kept me going, the urge to finish things I started. I could leave something midway. The idea of harvesting energy without burning fossil fuels but instead with bacteria? It was just such a cool idea and my curiosity kept me motivated. It’s a reminder that giving up is a choice, but it wouldn't sit right with me. Somehow, I managed to figure out how to complete this project and qualified as a State CSEF Fair Nominee and Honorable Mention, Project Planet Environment Award, and first at ACSEF in my category. The hands-on research experience taught me more than any of the awards or classroom lectures had ever done. Through this experience, I learned the importance of ambition, determination, and risk-taking. Innovators don’t make things from what already exists. When my team at Destination Imagination was awarded the Da Vinci Award at States this year for outstanding creativity and innovation, I felt like I could never stop loving what I was doing. I quickly found that I enjoyed coding and creating, and understanding why and how the world works around us. My 8th-grade science teacher recommended reading Campbell's Biology textbook. From recommendations, I joined the USA Biology Olympiad, and soon I found myself on a Science Olympiad team as well. Two years later, I'm a Board member of the DHS Science Olympiad team. Exploring gives me the will to continue searching, to continue learning. From researching hands-on with computer science application projects such as my microbial project to deep-diving online with cybersecurity CTFs. Wireshark problems are my specialty, due to the need for detail. This stemmed from my background in CyberPatriot, where I am a 3-time Semifinalist and Finalist last year. We became the first middle school team to participate in the CalPoly Cyber Innovation Challenge. <br> <br>
                                    Curiosity keeps my mind turning, it’s a reason why I push myself out of my comfort zone. When I force myself into situations and projects I’ve never done before, I feel like I’m growing, like I’m collecting a special token from every experience I go through. The pleasure and risk of it all, the idea of trying things out even when it doesn’t always seem to work out immediately reminds me that there’s always more ahead.</p>
