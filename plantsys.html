          <p>Project: Smart Home Plant Watering System <br> Course: Outside School (EC) <br> Duration: Approximately 2 weeks <br> Objective: Create a way to water a potted plant by itself based on humidity present within the soil, reading the moisture out to a LCD screen. <br> Type of Project: Solo</p>
          <p> <b> - </b> </p>
          <p>The goal of this system was to allow the plant to sustain itself with the help of this technology. The problem was that my family all runs on a tight schedule, with so much to do. My dad, however, loves plants and enjoys tending to his garden. Lately, he has not been able to help those plants, so I created a system that would replace his need to focus on taking care of the plants. This system will water the plant by itself, based on the humidity levels of the soil the plant is rooted into. Since I built this during quarantine, I did not have the ability to buy all the sensors I wanted to. Thus, I built my own humidity sensor by using two nails as the anodes and cathodes, passing current through it. Since water is conductive and polar, this energy passed through the nails excites the molecules, and the nails act as a sensor that is able to read how much "conductivity" is present around it. Since it's a digital sensor, it's able to read a variety of amounts. After calibrating it against a cup of no water as 0% humidity and a cup of dH20 as 100% humdity, the sensor was able to accurately guage the humdity present in its environment. This sensor was placed into the soil and connected with a breadboard to the Arduino microcontroller. Depending on if the humidity fell under a certain range, which was printed to the LCD screen wired along the side of the pot, the servo would be triggered. The servor motor would be triggered, and as per the physic law that water travels to its lowest point, the pipe would bend such that the water would fall out of the bottle into the pot. Thus, the plant was watered depending on the humditiy level of the soil. </p>
