          <p>Project: Entrepreneurship Project <br> Course: Honors Principles of Engineering <br> Duration: Approximately 2 weeks <br> Objective: Showcase an idea or proof of concept for the idea that would be marketable technology to solve real world problems with POE concepts <br> Type of Project: Group</p>
          <p> <b> - </b> </p>
          <p>This product aims to the fix the issue of recycling efficiently and effectively, as well as increasing the accessibility of recycling to make sure it happens more often, is an issue that needs to be addressed in order to slow the plastic pollution crisis. We developed a working prototype that autonomously recycles waste in a much more efficient and organized manner, distributing the waste into two possible groups, recyclable or landfill. This would further increase the chances of our waste materials being recycled and not having to end up in landfills, with the potential for reuse. Our solution consists of an Arduino Nano controlling a TCS3200 color module and a MG996R Servo to create a color sorting device. This prototype is proof of concept for a waste bin that could sort out between plastics and waste. In this case, the division of colors symbolizes the recyclable materials versus the waste. The video of our prototype sorting colored counters that represent the waste is available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NL-WESzWLaVhUtJ3cwUbwD7WZOMG-63z/view?usp=sharing">here</a>. To improve our product, we would start by acquiring a capacitive or inductive sensor for detecting plastic because the color sensor was a placeholder. The color sensor was simply showcasing the proof of concept, and how we could implement a product similar to this for the real world. Since our current prototype was more conceptual to determine the placement of the sensors and how the mechanisms would function, we would have to alter it to sort plastic. However, our prototype did an accurate job of sorting the “waste” (which was represented with different red and blue objects). While testing, we noticed that our objects had to be able to be rolled down the incline plane. If given more time, we could upgrade our incline plane to be a conveyor belt that moves the trash to its corresponding section after being scanned and identified. A conveyor belt would remove the issue of the trash not being able to slide down the inclined plane. The identification of the waste could also be improved, since this conceptual level of recognizing color could be replaced by a system that can recognize plastics, paper, metal or compost. The plastics can be identified with an inductive sensor, the paper or other cardboard-like materials identified by a density sensor, the metal identified through magnets and the compost identified through a moisture sensor. We also plan to improve the trash can so that it can handle greater amounts of trash at a faster speed. For example, while testing, we needed to scale the opening of the trash can down so the sensor’s width could span the entire opening. This ensured that the object falling through the opening had to pass the sensor on its way down. The scale of our prototype is relatively small to the human eye where it can be fit onto a desk or a table. The proper idea of what our ideal product would be if given more time and resources are shown above, in the sketch. The general gauge of the prototype can be moved upwards resulting in a larger amount of waste being distributed and recycled at a single time. With this larger scale in the automated recycler, an easy access door would be provided to open the waste bins. Having these easy access waste bins would result in the longevity of our product instead of having to constantly. My contribution to this project was surrounding the hardware circuiting work and coding of the product, as well as taking a heavy portion of the documentation as well. In class, I worked with Samiksha to create our cardboard prototype. We created two versions of the prototype, moving forward with the far sleeker design. I helped cut the cardboard pieces together with Samiksha, learning how to use exacto knives properly as well. After making the prototype, I worked on the hardware part with Prathik. We worked together after school to attach the servo motor at an angle, such that the objects would be pushed to their corresponding sides. The idea of how the “gate” would work was from brainstorming with Samiksha in class. I found how helpful it can be to be stuck at the same problem together, hitting the same wall. With Prathik, when coding the servo and training it to react with the color module, we found many setbacks. We noticed that the servo would recalibrate itself every time after resetting or unplugging from the computer, causing errors in our code. We had to switch to stored variables to fix this issue. Even so, the color module was slow and could not sense an object if it fell by quickly. This requires minor changes to our prototype as we were building our circuit. However, thanks to lots of working together, we were able to produce a functional prototype, which would represent the trash being recycled in a real world scenario. After completing the code and going through the different iterations of testing our prototype, I uploaded our circuit diagrams and code to a Github repository. Struggling with the code was quite fun, since I came across not only the servo calibration issues, but also struggled to understand how to use the color module. I think the satisfaction of getting our prototype to work in the end was worth the struggle. I believe that our product would be a good business deal, considering our prototype is a proof of concept for a final product that has so much potential, as well as being a unique model on the market.
